- NextJs  has a file-system based routing system
- URLs you can access in your browser are determined by how you organize your files and folders in your code

Routing convetions
1. All routes must be present inside the app folder
2. Route files must be name either page.js or page.jsx
3. each folder represent a segment of the URL path

when these convetions are followed, the file automatically becomes available as a route.
